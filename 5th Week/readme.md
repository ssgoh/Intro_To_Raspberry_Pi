With regards to the error when we added password to our Burglar Alarm program.
This is how to fix the problem

We have to put pause() into a while True loop, like this

while True:
   pause()

I have amended the program in BurglarAlarm.py.  Please download it for a look.
Programming is full of surprises. I learned something new yesterday.  :-)


I have also included some instructions for how to
1. Install Python on Windows PC
2. Install Thonny and Python (automatically) on Windows PC

You need both Thonny and Python to view the python codes on your windows PC.

You can email me at iamssgoh@gmail.com if you have any queries.  I will try my best to respond to you asap.

Hope to see you again at our Pi Club.  We meet first Sunday (12 to 3 pm) of every month.
